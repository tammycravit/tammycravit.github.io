I was having a conversation recently with a male engineer of my acquaintence.We were talking about a group I helped start at work for women in Development and Engineering. I explained why we'd started the group, what we hoped to accomplish, and why we felt having that space was important. 

I shared some of the experiences I've had throughout my career: times I had my opinion ignored because I was female. Even when I was the decision-maker. Times I was dismissed and talked over in meetings. The time a job candidate called me a "f**king bitch" for daring to communicate that I knew he was giving me a BS answer to a question. The times I've been sexually harassed in the workplace.

He nodded attentively. I thought he was starting to see my point. Then he looked at me and said, "Surely this can't be that much of a problem anymore, though. I mean, I've never seen people behave that way."

And in the blink of an eye, all that understanding and connection and empathy I thought we were building between us was gone. I had to fight my impulse to sigh out loud.

Here's the thing: There are all sorts of reasons my friend might not have experienced sexism and discrimination and harassment. The people in *his* life who were willing to behave that way toward women might not have been comfortable doing so in his presence, for example. He might not recognize what he sees as discrimination -- he might think that's just the way tech culture is. He might not think the things he sees are that serious. (I've been told to "lighten up and stop taking everything so seriously" more times than I can count.)

Whatever the reasons, his offhanded dismissal amounted to an act of erasure of my [lived experiences](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Lived_experience). Those things had never happened to *him*, he seemed to say, therefore they couldn't have happened. They couldn't have been as bad as I'd perceived. They must not have mattered that much. After all, *he'd* never experienced them.

Well, yeah, but the fact that I've never been to Toledo doesn't mean it doesn't exist, either.

That's the obvious logical flaw with the oh-so-common argument my friend presented to "refute" my experiences. For any one of us, there's a vast universe of experiences we've never had, things we've never done and places we've never visited. I've never been an NFL football player, never stood atop Mount Rainier, never swam with sea turtles in Micronesia. That doesn't mean other people haven't done those things, and it doesn't make them one iota less real for the people who *have* experienced them. 

If you're like my friend and you've never experienced sexism, prejudice or discrimination, I'm happy for you. But please don't tell me that *my* experiences aren't real or valid just because they're not *your* experiences. That's insulting, and worse than that, it derails any conversation about how to address those experiences. You can't fix a problem you don't acknowledge as real and valid.

TODO need to finish this
