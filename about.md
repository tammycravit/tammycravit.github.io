**Let’s be honest: Developing technology projects is hard, and doing it at scale is even harder.**

The principles and tools of DevOps – automation, repeatability, definable and measurable metrics, and a culture that values communication, respect, responsibility and trust – offer solutions to the traditional IT pitfalls. I’ve watched too many good projects, good technologies and good companies crash and burn, and DevOps provides an answer.

In my day job, I help tend and manage a large and complex database environment for a SaaS company in the health and wellness space. When your work includes juggling tens of thousands of databases, dozens of servers, and a rich mix of technologies (Microsoft SQL Server, NoSQL, Hadoop, and more), DevOps is the only way to get things done – at least, if you want them done right, and if you want to keep your sanity.

My life outside of work includes bicycling, yoga, writing (and reading) and backpacking with friends. And, of course, playing around with interesting technologies and tools, because that’s how tech women roll. Right now I’m excited about SQL Server, Powershell, NoSQL, Hadoop, DevOps, and data visualization.
